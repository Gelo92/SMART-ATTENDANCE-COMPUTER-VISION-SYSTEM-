SMART-ATTENDANCE COMPUTER VISION SYSTEM 

The goal of this project is to create an inexpensive smart attendance computer vision system that will detect and capture facial characteristics using the Fisherface algorithm and the Eigenface algorithm utilizing GUI applications and databases, this system will serve as a substitute for slow and inefﬁcient traditional manual attendance system. When a student enters the class and comes across the camera module of the system that captures their image and is recognized and validated if the student is present in class if recognized then his attendance is automatically marked via post-processing of the system


The system uses camera of the computer to recognize the students by showing their name above their picture. The system allows the teacher to check student's attendance automatically without any extra cost and effort whereas the proposed system needs very elementary things such as; camera, laptop or personal computer and local network. As soon as the student has been identified the student is marked present in the database. After identification of all the students the camera is closed and the students who were early, late, absent etc. are recorded in the database, and their statistics during the course of the module. Then with the help of the database which was created having the entry ﬁelds of student number, name, surname, attendance, date and time.
